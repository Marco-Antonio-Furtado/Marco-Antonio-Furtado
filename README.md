### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Marco, 17 years old, and looking for learning opportunities <img alt="Cowboy bebop gif" src="https://github.com/Marco-Antonio-Furtado/Marco-Antonio-Furtado/blob/main/cowboy-bebop.gif" width="80" height="70" />

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Next.js and front-end tools
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once have won a silver medal in a mathematical olympiad

I think that knowledge is the most powerfull thing in this world, and I pursuit it everyday; sometimes by coding, sometimes by reading an interesting book and sometimes through simple YouTube videos. I may not be an expert in any subject, but I give my best to comprehend every new piece of information and I will talk with you for hours if that means that I'll learn something new. 

So, if you think you can teach or give me the opportunity to learn me something new, please contact me at my e-mail: marcofurt@gmail.com
