### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Marco, 17 years old, and looking for learning/job opportunities 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# and Back-End tools, while improving my Front-End skills
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once have won a silver medal in a mathematical olympiad

I think that knowledge is the most powerfull thing in this world, and I pursuit it everyday; sometimes by coding, sometimes by reading an interesting book and sometimes through simple YouTube videos, giving my best to comprehend every new piece of information and find a pratical usage for it.
